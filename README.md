Juke -- An Elegant MPD Client
================================

Juke is a front-end, GTK+ (v2) client for the Music Playing Deamon. Its written entirely in [Google Go](http://golang.org/). While it is still in its early stages of development, it is not so bad to use (kind of).

The TODO List
-------------------------

* An "update" interrupt to update song progress, among other things.
* Current song album artwork.
* A juke logo.
* Icons and actions for secondary controls.
* A playlist browswer.
* A library browser.
