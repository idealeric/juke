Juke - A Different Kind of MPD Client
================================

Juke is a front-end, GTK+ (v2) client for the Music Playing Deamon. It is being developed for Linux and is written in [Go](http://golang.org/). It has an emphasis on speed and elegance, but also aims for a beautiful interface.

The TODO List
